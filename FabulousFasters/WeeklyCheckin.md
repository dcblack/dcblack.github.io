# ANNOUNCEMENT: November Changes

Teresa has been discussing some conflicts with me and has requested that I take over leadership in the group. She is not going away. Before I agreed to this, she took on the backup role. In other words, we are swapping roles.

We need to change the Zoom link so I can take over. So here it is:

Also, I will also formally introduce a bit more structure to the meeting format. I hope you like this; however, I am open to suggestions.

First, I request that everyone find a topic they could present to keep on hand. It could be a short video or book excerpt (e.g., a fabulous keto recipe, an exercise idea, or a mental aid for relaxing). Really, anything that we could discuss in terms of improving our health (weight reduction, reversing diabetes, lowering chronic risks). It could even be a question.

The meeting flow will be:
1. Round-robin: How was your week (successes, challenges, goals for next week)? [Require one of each.] Verbal interjections (ideally praises or sympathy) by others should be limited, but text interjections may be longer. Consider how many are attending, and try to keep your answers short enough to allow everyone to participate. This is our main focus - support.
2. More extended feedback may occur when discussing something that came up in step 1.
3. As time allows, we will solicit topics from anyone present. We want to keep the discussion within the one-hour format.

Finally, the Saturday Review will continue as is. Its primary focus is review; however, I would like a quick one-minute status & goal to be part of it. So the format is similar but with a different emphasis:
1. As you join (11 AM Eastern), please say hello, tell us how you are doing, and share your current top goal.
2. We will discuss the book or video casually. Please read or view it, but don't let the lack thereof keep you from attending. We will summarize and review its aspects.
