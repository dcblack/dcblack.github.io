Where: ==**Zoom Meeting CLICK HERE** ➜==https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84306206889?pwd=dtQL3XRSa52AM78d8pcIr7rzlEGWVE.1

What: ==Share your progress, questions, and goals==

#### Meeting flow

1. Round-robin: How was your week (successes, challenges, questions, and goals for next week)? [Require one of each.] Verbal interjections (ideally praises or sympathy) by others should be limited, but text interjections may be longer. Consider how many are attending, and try to keep your answers short enough to allow everyone to participate. This is our main focus - support.
2. More extended feedback may occur when discussing something that came up in step 1.
3. As time allows, we solicit "focused topics" from anyone present (see below). We want to keep the discussion within the one-hour format.

#### Focused topics

Everyone is requested to find a topic they could present to keep on hand. It could be a short video or book excerpt (e.g., a fabulous keto recipe, an exercise idea, or a mental aid for relaxing). Really, anything that we could discuss in terms of improving our health (weight reduction, reversing diabetes, lowering chronic risks). It could even be a question. Let me know and I can add your idea to the list below.

* Recipe ideas
* Recent news on keto
* Upcoming conferences
* Conference reports
* Fasting tips
* Scientific studies
