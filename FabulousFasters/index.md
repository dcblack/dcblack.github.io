Who are the Fabulous Fasters? A small support group of individuals that took Dr. Annette Bosworth's course, "21-Day Metabolic Kick". We meet weekly via Zoom to share our successes and challenges.

## History

#### April 2025 Changes

Meetings moved up a day. Now ==Tuesday== evenings and ==Friday== mornings!

#### February 2025 Changes

Added resources.

#### December 2024 Changes

New website organization: https://dcblack.github.io/FabulousFasters/. Refining contents.

#### November 2024 Changes

Teresa discussed some conflicts with me and has requested that I take over leadership in the group. She is not going away. Before I agreed to this, she took on the backup role. In other words, we are swapping roles.

We changed the Zoom link so I can take over. See [Weekly Checkin](https://dcblack.github.io/FabulousFasters/WeeklyCheckin.html) for details.

Also, I formally introduced a bit more structure to the meeting format. I hope you like this; however, I am open to suggestions. See above.

Finally, the [Book Review](https://dcblack.github.io/FabulousFasters/BookReview.html) will continue as is. Its primary focus is review; however, I would like a quick one-minute status & goal to be part of it. So, the format is similar but with a different emphasis.
