## Introduction [READ FIRST]

In this document, I have compiled a list of books, videos, doctors and researchers that express views on the impact of lifestyle on metabolic health. Specifically, I am researching what constitutes a healthy metabolism and how ketogenic and carnivore diets contribute to improved health. This aims to educate us on the scientific evidence supporting these approaches. By introducing trustworthy experts, I hope to help individuals better understand how to improve their own health and that of others. 

This is not a book nor a carefully written news article and may seem a bit messy at first. The idea is to give you names and references which you can search further. You might want to start with the list of [Books](#Books) and read some of the starred book titles. Or perhaps view some of the [Videos](#Videos).

## Methodology

So how do I qualify these "experts"? Good question! 

First, I watch a few of their videos, read some of their articles, and visit their websites (YouTube, Facebook, and personal if they have one). I also check Wikipedia and do a general search on their name. If they have critics (and many do), I consider the source and focus of the criticisms. Is "Big Food," "Big Pharma," "Big News Network," or some other giant (e.g., Google) challenging them? Or are the criticisms possibly bonafide?

Key aspects I look for:

1. Is the speaker selling something? Especially if it’s a miracle cure. It’s attractive when a speaker indicates that they offer free information. The only cost should be to voluntarily support the cause/speaker. I am very suspicious if there's a sole source for almost anything. Follow the money as they say.
2. Are they transparent about their own journey, or do they present themselves as experts? Beware of anybody who fails to back up their claims.
3. Can they show evidence of success? Anecdotal evidence is OK if there is a lot of it. When you have hundreds of successes, anecdotal takes on a different weight. Scientific evidence may not hold the same weight. Human studies are better than in vitro or animal studies. Also, statistical survey studies with self-reporting are suspect, even if large. Who paid for the studies?
4. Do they offer references to credible information? Does any of their information sound sketchy (e.g., I heard one individual talking about the spiritual alignment of electrons) or use     vague terminology? Does their information align somewhat with others, or are they unique? Have they discovered something nobody else has (i.e., they are out on a limb)
5. What are their credentials, and how long have they practiced? Links to biographies are helpful.

They may have some contrary ideas as long as they are open to the possibility that what they believe may need to be updated.

Importantly, I get concerned when they get too formal or appear full of themselves. Those with all the answers or indicating conspiracy theories are suspect in my book. It helps when I see cooperation between experts. I also pay attention when they are critical of one another. Science criticizes theories, not individuals. I look for corroboration.

I do have a few biases. I value practicing MDs over DOs. I also value bonafide PhD researchers, but animal studies are less valuable than human trials. I like explanations with graphics and chemistry.

Finally, I may change my mind over time.

# Categories

I've labeled a lot of material herein as part of a category. Most items are not isolated to a particular category and indeed many could be assigned to multiple categories. Some could even cross all categories; however, I've tried to label them with what I consider their primary focus. Here is a list of the categories:

Category labels (may be combined):

- **(A)**bout authors, channels
- **(B)**rain issues & Sleep
- **(C)**ancer
- **(D)**iabetes, Prediabetes, Insulinemia & Metabolism
- **(E)**strogen & Women's issues
- **(F)**alsehoods, lies & myths - Drugs, Food & Medical
- **(H)**eart & Cardiovascular Disease (incl. blood pressure)
- **(L)**ifestyle - Carnivore, Keto, Ketovore: Recipes, Cost, Concerns (see also (F)alsehoods)
- **(K)**etosis, Autophagy & Fasting (see also (D)

### Dr Richard Bernstein, MD

Dr. Stanley K. Bernstein, MD, General Practitioner, is an experienced physician in the field of Bariatrics and has been practicing for over 40 years. Bariatrics is the medical management (the study and treatment) of obesity and weight loss. He has been helping people lose weight quickly and safely and to keep it off long term.

Inspired by a passion to actively improve the quality of his patients’ lives and frustrated by the poor results of obesity treatment administered by most physicians and commercial diet clinics, Dr. Bernstein spent years researching and developing The Dr. Bernstein Diet <https://www.diabetes-book.com/laws-small-numbers/>.

------

*“I want to help people lose weight before they face unnecessary medical problems down the road”* – Dr. Bernstein

------

Dr. Bernstein graduated from the University of Toronto in 1966 and interned at the renowned Mount Sinai Hospital. As a physician, his personal goals and professional aspirations have always had one commonality: a commitment to go beyond merely monitoring and treating symptoms in his patients, but to correct the underlying problems and truly improve their quality of life.

Following his internship, he went into family practice and took on geriatric work at the renowned Baycrest Centre. His reputation as a GP saw him quickly develop a very busy family practice.

It was during these years that he became disappointed with the inadequate results with the methods for the treatment of obesity that he was taught in medical school.
Dr. Bernstein wanted to focus on treating the underlying problem causing health issues in his patients and to provide a treatment process with better results.

His interest in the condition of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) led him to develop a method of controlling hunger through the introduction of vitamins, minerals and proper diet that proved effective in reducing cravings. He also joined the American Society of Bariatric Physicians, an organization devoted to educating physicians in methods of treating obesity.

Finally, after years of development and research, he began administering a unique diet program that generated dramatic results achieving rapid and healthy weight loss.

The Bernstein Weight Loss/Disease Management practice grew primarily by word of mouth over 40 clinics across Canada today. To date, with the network of clinics staffed with specially-trained nurses and doctors, The Bernstein Diet has helped hundreds of thousands of people lose millions of pounds of excess weight, improving their health, longevity and quality of life.

<h5>Wikipedia:</h5>

Physician and an advocate for a [low-carbohydrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate) diabetes [diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)) to help achieve normal blood sugars for [diabetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetics). Bernstein has [type 1 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1). His private medical practice in [Mamaroneck, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamaroneck_(town),_New_York) is devoted solely to treating diabetes and prediabetes. https://www.drbdiet.com/

Dr. Bernstein contends that high blood sugars are the cause of all diabetic complications, and therefore that tightly controlling blood sugar eliminates complications. This contention was at first at odds with established medical opinion, as the sugar-complications link was not yet clearly established from scientific studies. A 1993 study supported Bernstein's position that tight control of blood sugar leads to better health.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-NYT2-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-7)

Bernstein's low-carbohydrate diet was initially opposed by the American Diabetes Association, which recommended a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet for diabetics.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-8) The ADA has since changed its position to allow a low-carbohydrate diet as an acceptable option for diabetics.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-9)[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-10) The UK NHS has also introduced a low-carbohydrate plan for diabetics and prediabetics.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-11)

Bernstein's focus on maintaining low blood sugar targets conflicts with mainstream guidance to maintain a higher fasting blood sugar target for insulin-dependent patients (such as Type 1 diabetics).[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-12) This higher target is to reduce the risk of [hypoglycemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia) which can be fatal. Type 1 diabetics on Bernstein's regime need to be constantly on guard against hypoglycemia. Bernstein claims however that the hypoglycemia risk is even higher with the high-carb low-fat original ADA standard diet because it requires big doses of insulin.[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Bernstein#cite_note-13)

### Dr Ben Bikman ★

[Dr Ben Bikman](https://cell.byu.edu/directory/benjamin-bikman) is a researcher and expert in the field of bioenergetics and metabolic disorders. His research focus is on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that mediate the disruption that causes and accompanies metabolic disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. He has a Ph.D. in Bioenergetics and was a postdoctoral fellow with the Duke-National University of Singapore in metabolic disorders.

As a professor at Brigham Young University and the director of its Diabetes Research Lab, Dr Bikman has continued to study insulin, including its role as a regulator of human metabolism, as well as insulin’s relevance in chronic disease. He has also written a book, [“Why We Get Sick](https://a.co/d/gOj0gym)”, which makes the case for insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction as the underlying cause of many of our modern health problems.

Dr Bikman’s work has been recognized for its significance in understanding the role of insulin resistance in chronic disease, and he has been a popular speaker on the topics of human metabolism and nutrition. He is a member of the Levels Medical Advisory Board and has been featured in various media outlets for his expertise in the field.

<h5>Biography</h5>

I was born in a little farm town on the wind-swept prairies of Southern Alberta, Canada. Being the ninth of 13 children, I quickly learned essential life lessons—eat quickly, shower quickly, don’t insult seven older brothers, but if an insult is necessary, run quickly. 

After my mission in Samara, Russia, I came to BYU. My pathway in academia began with my fascination with the body’s adaptations to exercise. I continued on this path for my doctoral studies at East Carolina University with Dr Lynis Dohm. However, during this time, my interests shifted—rather than exploring the adaptations to exercise, I focused on the adaptations to and progression of obesity. Following a postdoctoral fellowship with the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School in Singapore with Dr Scott Summers, I accepted a position in the PDBIO department at BYU. 

My research interests at BYU continue my interests in the causes and consequences of obesity with particular emphasis on insulin resistance.

### Dominic D'Agostino, PhD ★

Dominic D’Agostino is an Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. He is also a Research Scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC).

**Research Focus**

His laboratory develops and tests metabolic-based strategies for targeting CNS oxygen toxicity (seizures), epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, brain cancer, and muscle wasting associated motorneuron diseases and cancer. He has adapted many of these techniques for use inside hyperbaric chambers, which allows him to manipulate oxygen concentrations (from hypoxia to hyperbaric oxygen).

**Ketogenic Diet and Metabolism**

D’Agostino’s research focuses on understanding the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective mechanisms of the ketogenic diet and ketone metabolite supplementation. He has shown that the shift in brain metabolism (from glucose to ketones) reduces neuronal hyperexcitability, oxidative stress, and enhances brain metabolism. This approach can be used to treat a wide variety of pathologies linked pathophysiologically to metabolic dysregulation, including cancer.

**Other Interests and Expertise**

D’Agostino has a personal interest in environmental medicine and methods to enhance safety and physiological resilience in extreme environments. He was a research investigator and crew member on NASA’s Extreme Environment Mission Operation (NEEMO 22). His research is supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Department of Defense (DoD), private organizations, and foundations.

**Public Engagement**

D’Agostino is a well-known expert in his field and has been featured on various media outlets, including Joe Rogan, Tim Ferriss, Impact Theory, TED, and dozens of other top media outlets. He has also collaborated with other researchers and experts in the field, exploring topics such as high-fat diets, time-restricted feeding, fasting, and nutrition psychotherapy.

### Dr Katie Deming, MD

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drkatiedeming/) [Links](https://linktr.ee/drkatiedeming)

I am a Conscious Integrative Oncologist with a virtual practice who is passionate about helping my clients heal the root causes of cancer and chronic disease. I believe that true healing is possible for everyone, regardless of the stage of their disease. 

My approach to healing considers the myriad roots of disease, including cancer. I believe water is one of the most important components of healing as it is the unifying connector of mind, body, emotion, and spirit. From the physical structure of the water in our body to the quality of the water we consume, to our ability to process and release negative emotions (often metaphorically represented by water), and our spiritual connection to its consciousness, water plays a critical role in the healing process. My mission is to synthesize and simplify these pieces into an accessible protocol that anyone can understand and apply, drawing on the ways medicine was viewed and practiced in ancient times.

Experience & Accomplishments:

\- TEDx Speaker

\- Duke trained former Board Certified Radiation Oncologist specializing in breast and gynecologic malignancies.

\- Host of the "Born to Heal Podcast with Dr. Katie Deming"

\- Served as Northwest Representative on Kaiser Permanente's National Cancer Leaders Council. 

\- Creator of the first Cancer-Specific Patient Advisory Council within Kaiser Permanente nationally. 

\- Clinical Expert in Co-Design of Cancer Care. Co-design is the collaborative process of involving patients in every stage of care design and evaluation

### Dave Feldman

I’m a senior software engineer and entrepreneur.

I began a low-carb, high-fat diet in April 2015 and have since learned everything I could about it with special emphasis on cholesterol given my lipid numbers spiked substantially after going on the diet. As an engineer, I spotted a pattern in the lipid system that’s very similar to distributed objects in networks.

I’ve since learned quite a bit on the subject both through research and experimentation which has revealed some very powerful data (see my Cholesterol Code series [Part I](http://cholesterolcode.com/cholesterol-code-part-i/), [Part II](http://cholesterolcode.com/cholesterol-code-part-ii-the-ldl-p-gap/), [Part III](http://cholesterolcode.com/cholesterol-code-part-iii-the-divergence/), [Part IV](http://cholesterolcode.com/cholesterol-code-part-iv-still-correlating-in-the-reverse/), and [Part V](http://cholesterolcode.com/cholesterol-code-part-v-more-fat-less-cholesterol-to-the-second-power/)).

As of this writing, my “Extreme Drop” experiment has gotten the most attention (see [infographic here](http://cholesterolcode.com/infographic-of-prediction-experiment/), and [do-it-yourself page here](http://cholesterolcode.com/extreme-cholesterol-drop-experiment/)) where I induced a 73 point drop in my LDL-C and a 1115 point drop in my LDL-P.

### Dr Daniel Maggs, GP

General Practitioner (British medical doctor) focussed on men's health. From his web site <https://drdanmaggs.com>:

> I struggled with my weight my entire life, and by the time I was fully qualified as a GP, I was well into the “obese” classification. The problem was, whatever I tried didn’t seem to work. Each attempt at turning things around was met with disappointment and more weight gain. I was worried about my future health and thought I was well on my way to diabetes.
>
> Despite being a medical professional, I felt helpless and unsure of how to break the cycle. The conventional “eat less, move more” advice wasn’t working for me. It left me feeling frustrated and stuck, as I meticulously counted calories and pushed myself to exercise, only to see no lasting results. The fear of serious health issues loomed over me, and I didn’t know what to do.
>
> A chance encounter while skiing in 2016 led me to see things in a different way. This pivotal moment opened my eyes to new, science-backed strategies for health and weight management that went beyond the conventional advice.
>
> By shifting my focus from simply eating less and moving more to understanding my body’s unique needs, I was able to reverse my obesity in just over six months. (30kg / 66lbs)
>
> Since then, I’ve maintained my weight loss and transformed my life. Today, I am lighter, fitter, and more energetic than ever before.
>
> Now, I want to share these insights with you, to show that it is possible to overcome these challenges and achieve lasting health, no matter what stage you’re at or how many times you’ve tried before.
