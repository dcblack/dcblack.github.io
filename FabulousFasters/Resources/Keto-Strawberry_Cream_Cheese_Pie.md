- Prep Time: 20 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes (for crust)
- Servings: 12
- Temperature: 325°F (163°C) for crust

**Ingredients:**

- **Almond flour**: 1 ½ cups (180 g)
- **Butter, salted, melted**: ¼ cup (56 g)
- **Confectioners keto sweetener**: ¼ cup (30 g)
- **Cream cheese, full-fat, softened**: 8 oz (227 g)
- **Strawberries, sliced**: 2 pounds (907 g), with 1 ½ cups (225 g) reserved for purée
- **Sugar-free strawberry gelatin**: 0.88 oz (25 g) package (8 servings)
- **Water**: 1 cup (240 ml)
- **Heavy whipping cream**: 1 cup (240 ml)
- **Keto confectioners sweetener**: 1 tablespoon (12 g)
- **Vanilla extract**: 1 teaspoon (5 ml)

**Equipment needed:**

- 9.5-inch pie dish or springform pan
- Medium mixing bowl
- Food processor or blender (for puréeing strawberries)
- Stand mixer or hand mixer (for whipping cream)
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Aluminum foil (for crimping crust edges)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, mix together almond flour, melted butter, and keto confectioners sweetener until well combined.
2. Pour the mixture into a pie dish and firmly press with fingers or the bottom of a measuring cup to form an even crust.
3. Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning and pierce the crust in several spots with a fork.
4. Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let cool while preparing the filling.
5. In a food processor, purée 1 ½ cups of sliced strawberries to make approximately 1 cup of purée.
6. In a small saucepan, dissolve the sugar-free strawberry gelatin in 1 cup of cold water. Add the strawberry purée and heat over medium heat until it barely boils. Remove from heat and place in the freezer for 30 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
7. While the gelatin mixture chills, spread the softened cream cheese evenly over the cooled pie crust.
8. Top the cream cheese with the remaining sliced strawberries.
9. Once the gelatin-strawberry purée mixture has cooled, pour it over the sliced strawberries in the crust.
10. Place the pie in the refrigerator to set for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for best results.
11. To make the whipped cream topping, place the heavy whipping cream, keto confectioners sweetener, and vanilla extract in a stand mixer and mix on high until stiff peaks form.
12. Top the chilled pie with the whipped cream just before serving.

**Safety Notes:** Ensure the gelatin mixture is cooled before pouring over the cream cheese to prevent melting. Use a clean, dry bowl and utensils when whipping cream to achieve stiff peaks. Keep the pie refrigerated until ready to serve.

**Substitutions:** Almond flour can be substituted with sunflower seed flour for a nut-free option. For a different berry flavor, use raspberry or blueberry gelatin. If you prefer a baked crust, you can use a pre-made low-carb pie crust.

**Storage:** This pie can be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. It can also be frozen, though it's recommended to add the whipped cream topping only after thawing to maintain texture.

**Pro Tips:** For a more vibrant color, use fresh, ripe strawberries. The pie can be made the day before serving, which allows the flavors to meld and the filling to set properly. The gelatin layer should be firm but not overly hard when set.
