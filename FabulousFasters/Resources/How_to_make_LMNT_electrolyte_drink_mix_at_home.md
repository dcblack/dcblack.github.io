## **A Science-Backed Quantity of Electrolytes**

In the many years we spent mixing electrolyte drinks at home before LMNT existed, we made many messes and had quite a few misses, but we also came up with several great recipes. If you prefer to source your own electrolytes instead buying [LMNT](https://drinklmnt.com/collections/salt), jot this down and grab a kitchen scale:

- 2,500 mg sodium chloride (for 1,000 mg sodium)
- 385 mg potassium chloride (for 200 mg potassium)
- 390 mg magnesium malate **OR** 265 mg di-magnesium malate (for 60 mg magnesium)

Or, to save time, you can measure 30 servings at once!

- 75 grams sodium chloride
- 11.5 grams potassium chloride
- 11.7 grams magnesium malate **OR** 8 grams di-magnesium malate.

Once you’re finished measuring, be sure to mix your ingredients together thoroughly. Then, simply weigh each serving out — if you used magnesium malate, one serving weighs about 3.3 grams; if you used di-magnesium malate, one serving weighs about 3.15 grams.

These are the same [science-backed](https://science.drinklmnt.com/electrolytes/lmnts-electrolyte-ratios-explained/) electrolyte amounts and ratios in each grab-and-go stick pack of LMNT. It’s the equivalent of our simplest product: [LMNT Raw Unflavored](https://drinklmnt.com/products/lmnt-recharge-electrolyte-drink?variant=16358367232034). You can use the electrolytes above as a base to create your own recipes (add your own flavor), or simply follow the guides below to recreate 4 of our most popular flavors.

## **How to Make 4 Popular LMNT Flavors**

- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- Dash of stevia, to taste

DIRECTIONS: Stir or shake to mix well, and serve over ice.

## **Work Smarter, Not Harder**

Preparing a bulk mix can save you a lot of time and mess. Simply multiply each number above by however many servings you’d like to prep, and blend them together thoroughly. Then, when you’re ready to get salty, scoop about 3.2 grams into 16–32 oz of water, and add a dash of your preferred sweetener and flavors.

If you don’t have a blender or shaker, you can always pre-measure your individual servings into a smaller container, such as a monthly pill box. That way, you only need to measure ingredients once per month.

## **What If I Don’t Own a Scale?**

It’s worth noting that we intentionally share our electrolyte homebrew formula with weight measurements rather than volume measurements (like teaspoons) because volume isn’t always a consistent measure of quantity. The salt and electrolyte powders you buy may be more or less dense than some others on the market, which may skew how much electrolytes you’re getting in each serving.

However, if you don’t own a scale, you can get pretty close to the formula above using the following volume measurements (in teaspoons):

- About 1/2 teaspoon sodium chloride (provides ~1,000 mg sodium)
- About 1/15 teaspoon potassium chloride (provides ~200 mg potassium chloride)
- About 1/10 teaspoon di-magnesium malate (provides ~60 mg magnesium)

That said, teaspoon sets typically don’t come with a 1/10 or 1/15 teaspoons to measure with, and measuring each serving individually can be quite tedious. To save time and measure more accurately, you can make 30 servings at once. Simply combine:

- 15 teaspoons sodium chloride
- 2 teaspoons potassium chloride
- 3 teaspoons di-magnesium malate

Be sure to mix them together thoroughly afterwards. Then, to get a single serving, scoop about 2/3 teaspoon into 16–32 oz water and flavor it to suit your taste! However you get your electrolytes in, you’re sure to notice a difference in how you feel and perform when you consume enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

Stay Salty,
