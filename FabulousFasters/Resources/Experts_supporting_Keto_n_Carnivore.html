Specifically, I am researching what constitutes a healthy metabolism and how ketogenic and carnivore diets contribute to improved health. This aims to educate us on the scientific evidence supporting these approaches. By introducing trustworthy experts, I hope to help individuals better understand how to improve their own health and that of others. </span></p><p><span>This is not a book nor a carefully written news article and may seem a bit messy at first. The idea is to give you names and references which you can search further. You might want to start with the list of </span><a href='#books'><span>Books</span></a><span> and read some of the starred book titles. Or perhaps view some of the </span><a href='#videos-changing-minds'><span>Videos Changing Minds</span></a><span>.</span></p><h2 id='methodology'><span>Methodology</span></h2><p><span>So how do I qualify these &quot;experts&quot;? Good question! </span></p><p><span>First, I watch a few of their videos, read some of their articles, and visit their websites (YouTube, Facebook, and personal if they have one). I also check Wikipedia and do a general search on their name. If they have critics (and many do), I consider the source and focus of the criticisms. Is &quot;Big Food,&quot; &quot;Big Pharma,&quot; &quot;Big News Network,&quot; or some other giant (e.g., Google) challenging them? Or are the criticisms possibly bonafide?</span></p><p><span>Key aspects I look for:</span></p><ol start='' ><li><p><span>Is the speaker selling something? Especially if it’s a miracle cure. It’s attractive when a speaker indicates that they offer free information. The only cost should be to voluntarily support the cause/speaker. I am very suspicious if there&#39;s a sole source for almost anything. Follow the money as they say.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Are they transparent about their own journey, or do they present themselves as experts? Beware of anybody who fails to back up their claims.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can they show evidence of success? Anecdotal evidence is OK if there is a lot of it. When you have hundreds of successes, anecdotal takes on a different weight. Scientific evidence may not hold the same weight. Human studies are better than in vitro or animal studies. Also, statistical survey studies with self-reporting are suspect, even if large. Who paid for the studies?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Do they offer references to credible information? Does any of their information sound sketchy (e.g., I heard one individual talking about the spiritual alignment of electrons) or use     vague terminology? Does their information align somewhat with others, or are they unique? Have they discovered something nobody else has (i.e., they are out on a limb)</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are their credentials, and how long have they practiced? Links to biographies are helpful.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>They may have some contrary ideas as long as they are open to the possibility that what they believe may need to be updated.</span></p><p><span>Importantly, I get concerned when they get too formal or appear full of themselves. Those with all the answers or indicating conspiracy theories are suspect in my book. It helps when I see cooperation between experts. I also pay attention when they are critical of one another. Science criticizes theories, not individuals. I look for corroboration.</span></p><p><span>I do have a few biases. I value practicing MDs over DOs. I also value bonafide PhD researchers, but animal studies are less valuable than human trials.

Bernstein, MD, General Practitioner, is an experienced physician in the field of Bariatrics and has been practicing for over 40 years. Bariatrics is the medical management (the study and treatment) of obesity and weight loss. He has been helping people lose weight quickly and safely and to keep it off long term.</span></p><p><span>Inspired by a passion to actively improve the quality of his patients’ lives and frustrated by the poor results of obesity treatment administered by most physicians and commercial diet clinics, Dr. Bernstein spent years researching and developing The Dr. Bernstein Diet </span><a href='https://www.diabetes-book.com/laws-small-numbers/' target='_blank' class='url'>https://www.diabetes-book.com/laws-small-numbers/</a><span>.</span></p><hr /><p><em><span>“I want to help people lose weight before they face unnecessary medical problems down the road”</span></em><span> – Dr. Bernstein</span></p><hr /><p><span>Dr. Bernstein graduated from the University of Toronto in 1966 and interned at the renowned Mount Sinai Hospital. As a physician, his personal goals and professional aspirations have always had one commonality: a commitment to go beyond merely monitoring and treating symptoms in his patients, but to correct the underlying problems and truly improve their quality of life.</span></p><p><span>Following his internship, he went into family practice and took on geriatric work at the renowned Baycrest Centre. His reputation as a GP saw him quickly develop a very busy family practice.</span></p><p><span>It was during these years that he became disappointed with the inadequate results with the methods for the treatment of obesity that he was taught in medical school.</span>
<span>Dr. Bernstein wanted to focus on treating the underlying problem causing health issues in his patients and to provide a treatment process with better results.</span></p><p><span>His interest in the condition of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) led him to develop a method of controlling hunger through the introduction of vitamins, minerals and proper diet that proved effective in reducing cravings. He also joined the American Society of Bariatric Physicians, an organization devoted to educating physicians in methods of treating obesity.</span></p><p><span>Finally, after years of development and research, he began administering a unique diet program that generated dramatic results achieving rapid and healthy weight loss.</span></p><p><span>The Bernstein Weight Loss/Disease Management practice grew primarily by word of mouth over 40 clinics across Canada today. To date, with the network of clinics staffed with specially-trained nurses and doctors, The Bernstein Diet has helped hundreds of thousands of people lose millions of pounds of excess weight, improving their health, longevity and quality of life.</span></p><h5>Wikipedia:</h5><p><span>Physician and an advocate for a </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate'><span>low-carbohydrate</span></a><span> diabetes </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)'><span>diet</span></a><span> to help achieve normal blood sugars for </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetics'><span>diabetics</span></a><span>.

I believe water is one of the most important components of healing as it is the unifying connector of mind, body, emotion, and spirit.

The problem was, whatever I tried didn’t seem to work. Each attempt at turning things around was met with disappointment and more weight gain. I was worried about my future health and thought I was well on my way to diabetes.</span></p><p><span>Despite being a medical professional, I felt helpless and unsure of how to break the cycle. The conventional “eat less, move more” advice wasn’t working for me. It left me feeling frustrated and stuck, as I meticulously counted calories and pushed myself to exercise, only to see no lasting results. The fear of serious health issues loomed over me, and I didn’t know what to do.</span></p><p><span>A chance encounter while skiing in 2016 led me to see things in a different way. This pivotal moment opened my eyes to new, science-backed strategies for health and weight management that went beyond the conventional advice.</span></p><p><span>By shifting my focus from simply eating less and moving more to understanding my body’s unique needs, I was able to reverse my obesity in just over six months. (30kg / 66lbs)</span></p><p><span>Since then, I’ve maintained my weight loss and transformed my life. Today, I am lighter, fitter, and more energetic than ever before.</span></p><p><span>Now, I want to share these insights with you, to show that it is possible to overcome these challenges and achieve lasting health, no matter what stage you’re at or how many times you’ve tried before.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He sells a course on men&#39;s wellness.</span></p><p><span> </span><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/drdanmaggs/'><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span> </span><a href='https://www.facebook.com/drdanmaggs/reviews'><span>Facebook</span></a><span> </span></p><p><a href='#toc'><span>Back to Table of Contents</span></a></p><h3 id='dr-marty-makary-md-★'><span>Dr Marty Makary, MD ★</span></h3><p><span>Dr. Marty Makary is a </span><em><span>New York Times</span></em><span> bestselling author and health care expert at Johns Hopkins University.
