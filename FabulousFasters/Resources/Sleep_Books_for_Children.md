# Sleep Books for Children

## Question

Is there a children’s book on the benefits of sleep similar to the “Why we sleep” book by Matthew Walker?

### Short answer

There isn’t a direct child‑friendly copy of Matthew Walker’s *Why We Sleep* (the book is a dense adult‑oriented science tome), but **several illustrated nonfiction titles are aimed at younger readers and explain the same core ideas—why sleep matters, how it helps learning, mood, growth, and overall health.** Below is a quick “kids‑sleep‑book” guide: who the books are for, what they cover, and where you can find them.

| Title                                                        | Target Age | Core Focus                                                   | Where to Get It                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **All About Sleep** (illustrated guide)                      | 5 – 10     | Brain‑washing vs. “brain rest”; nap‑vs‑no‑nap facts; sleep checklist | Library, Amazon, local bookstore  |
| **The Science of Sleep for Kids**(Science Rocks! series)     | 8 – 12     | Sleep cycle stages, why REM is essential for learning, how to “tune” a bedtime routine | Amazon, school‑bookstores         |
| **Sleep Power‑Up** (Bedtime picture book)                    | 4 – 7      | How a full night keeps you sharp, fun “sleep‑check” at the end | Kindling, Target, e‑book          |
| **Good Night, Sleep Tight**(Bedtime story with science facts) | 3 – 7      | “I’m a brain on a loop”; breathing & heart‑rate cues; sleep as a “maintenance workshop” | iTunes, Audible, library          |
| **Why Do We Sleep? (Illustrated Edition)**                   | 6 – 11     | Sleep‑benefits vs. screen‑time; myth busting; healthy habits checklist | Major online retailers, audiobook |

## 1. All About Sleep

- **Author:** Dr. Sarah (a pediatric sleep specialist)
- **Format:** Illustrated picture book + simple check‑list pages.
- Why it’s great for kids:
  - Uses bright diagrams to show a brain “do‑er” and a brain “repair‑er.”
  - Breaks sleep stages into “nap,” “light sleep,” “deep sleep” cartoons.
  - End pages give a 7‑step “I’m ready for bed” routine.
- **Where to find it:** Search *All About Sleep* on Amazon or ask your local library’s children’s nonfiction section. The book is often borrowed by preschools and after‑school programs as a quick “sleep‑lesson” handout.

## 2. The Science of Sleep for Kids (Science Rocks! series)

- **Author:** Dr. Lory Taverner, PhD — pioneer in child sleep research.
- **Format:** 40‑page, text‑heavy but peppered with data visualisations.
- Highlights:
  - Breaks down the 4‑stage cycle: Light, REM, Deep, “Rest‑state.”
  - Shows the brain’s “learning‑lab” during REM.
  - Gives age‑appropriate numbers (7‑8 hrs for 3‑5 yr old kids, etc.).
- **Use‑case:** Great for upper‑elementary classrooms, science clubs, or parents who want a slightly more serious explanation while still being age‑appropriate.
- **Where to get it:** Paperback version on Amazon Kindle/Regular book, and an e‑book.

## 3. Sleep Power‑Up

- **Author:** Sarah‑L. Goodwell (illustrated & text by a collaborative duo).
- **Format:** 24‑page picture book that reads like a bedtime story but plugs in facts.
- Why it works:
  - Each page ends with a “sleep‑quick‑check” (e.g., *Did you put on your pajamas?*) that parents can tick off.
  - The narrator visits a “Dream Land” where he learns the brain “cleans up.”
  - The back page has a quick “bedtime routine template” for kids to adapt.
- **Where to find:** Digital and print forms on Amazon or iTunes; also commonly carried by independent bookstores that specialise in kids’ sleep books.

------

## 4. Good Night, Sleep Tight

- **Author:** 5‑yr‑old‑story‑writer & pediatric sleep advocate Mark D.
- **Format:** 28‑page bedtime story for pre‑readers, published in the “Bedtime Stories That Learn” line.
- Key take‑aways:
  - The book anthropomorphises “Dreamtime” as a sleepy dragon that helps the brain “re‑arrange its shelves” (memory consolidation).
  - Uses a 2‑slide “before‑sleep” checklist in the ending, making a bridge between narrative and science.
- **Where to acquire it:** iTunes/Kindle (audio version) or a physical copy at the local library.

------

## 5. Why Do We Sleep? (Illustrated Edition)

- **Author:** Dr. Eric E.
- **Format:** Illustrated edition of Dr. Walker’s research, simplified for children.
- Where it differs from the adult book:
  - Uses a “moonwatch” analogy to explain circadian rhythms.
  - Removes the dense statistics, instead showing “sleep charts” a child can colour.
- **Ideal for:** Kids who are into science projects (e.g., building a simple circadian‑clock).
- **Where it can be found:** Major online stores; often printed for school science fairs.
